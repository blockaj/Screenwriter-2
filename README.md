##Contributions
The best way to contribute is to submit issues in the issues section. If the 
issue can be associated with a milestone it is a good idea to give that issue
a milestone. Issues on Github can be written with Markdown. It is recommended
that issues follow this format:

```
# Background
Some background information on the different variables, classes, etc. that
are related to your issues.
# Problem
The problem this issue is trying to address.
# Where to find
List important variable, classes, etc. and where in the source code they can be
found. At least include the file where this can be found and the line.
```
